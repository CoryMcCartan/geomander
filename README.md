Geographic Tools for Studying Gerrymandering

R package, in development. Focuses on creating data sets and other tools that help make understanding gerrymandering faster and easier. Designed for easy preparation to run simulation analysis with the R package redist, but is aimed at the geographic aspects of redistricting, not partitioning methods. Most of these tools are gathered from seminar papers and do not correspond to a single publication.
